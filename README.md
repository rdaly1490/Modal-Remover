# Modal Remover

This extension will help you get rid of modals that appear on sites blocking content.

Clicking the extension will attempt to get rid of the modal.  As all sites are made differently, it may take multiple cicks before the modal is found and removed.  So if it doesn't appear to work on the first try give the button a few more clicks.  This extension also tries to take care of re-enabling scrolling and touch interactions which may have been blocked by the code which enabled the modal.

This is a work in progress and will need plenty of testing on different sites.
